# zeru-wallet-credit-scoring

This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to assign **credit scores (0â€“1000)** to DeFi wallets based on their **historical transaction behavior** on the Aave V2 protocol (Polygon network).

##  Problem Statement

Given 100K+ transaction records across various actions (deposit, borrow, repay, redeem, liquidationcall), score each wallet on a 0â€“1000 scale:

- ðŸ”¼ High score â†’ responsible & reliable wallet
- ðŸ”½ Low score â†’ risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior

---

##  Method Chosen

Since the dataset lacks labeled outcomes (i.e., we donâ€™t know which wallets defaulted), we use an **unsupervised anomaly detection approach**:

###  `IsolationForest`
- Works well with mixed behaviors and numeric features
- Identifies outlier behavior based on feature distributions
- Outputs a score which we **rescale to 0â€“1000**

This helps detect wallets with unusual patterns (e.g., repeated borrowing with no deposit, very short transaction intervals, or frequent liquidations).
